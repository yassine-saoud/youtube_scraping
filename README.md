# youtube_scraping
The main objective of our project is to use the Python Selenium library to extract data from the YouTube website. To achieve this, we decided to scrape videos from any YouTube channel. However, since we want to extract a large amount of data (almost 10,000 records), we chose the "sky news" channel as it contains more than 20,000 videos. For each video, we will scrape the following seven pieces of information:

Title
Channel
Number of views
Number of likes
Number of comments
Publication date
Duration
Link to the video
